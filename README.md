# Zombie Shooter

## by 238SAMIxD

### Description

Pretty simple FPS game made for the [OKE Software](https://oke.pl/) `Unity` and `C#` live course provided by [Wojciech Bilicki](https://www.youtube.com/@CyberPotatoDev)

### Assets

This game is based on an online tutorial available on [tutorialsEU Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jk85v08gmtc)

I used 3D assets from [Kenney](https://kenney.nl) and [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/)

There is no sound within the game

### Launching the game

There are several options to run the game without installation

* Download one of the packages in the [Release](https://github.com/238SAMIxD/Zombie-Shooter/releases/tag/v1.0.0) section
* Download `bin.7z` or `bin.zip` file from `bin (packed)` directory, unpack it and run `FPS game.exe` file

### Gameplay

There are no many mechanics but here are the controls:

* **Mouse** - moving the crosshair
* **WASD/Arrow keys** - moving the character
* **LMB (Left Mouse Button)** - shooting

Every zombie killed is worth `round Ã— 10` points where `round` is just a number of current round played.

Each round zombies are doubled and randomly spawned on the 6 spawnpoints.

Player has 100 health points and game is over when it reaches 0. What is more after every won round player regenerates 10 health.

There are two zombie types. One faster but does 10 damage and the second one slower with 20 damage per hit.
